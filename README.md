#Software Setting.
1. Loop MIDI (for Windows.)
  "+" to create new port.

2. Hairless MIDI<-> Serial Bridge
 setting at 38400bps
 "MIDI In"  set "loopMIDI Port" 
 "Serial Port " set "Arduino Uno (COM*)"

if you Program Arduino, Loop midi "Serial <-> MIDI Bridge " OFF!



#Problem 
1. timing Little delay?

2. After  Lighting.

and "ControlChange"ã€€120 is All sound Off //121 Reset All controller // 123 All Note Off  : All LED OFF
